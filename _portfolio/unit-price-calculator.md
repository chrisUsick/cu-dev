Unit Price Calculator
[View App on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cuDev.unitPrice)  

Unit Price Calculator is a simple app for calculating and comparing unit prices. The app lets a user enter the price, quantity and optionally the units of the item. The user can calculate just 1 unit price, or 2 or more. They are compared in a table, in ascending order of unit price. The user has the option to edit the data or enter new unit prices.

This app was created in 1 day using Cordova and AngularJS. I will add new features to that app eventually. The next feature will be actual unit conversion, allowing each unit price to be entered in different units, and have the output generated in 1 unit. I will also improve the styling and UI of the app and add the logo to appear like a more well rounded app."
